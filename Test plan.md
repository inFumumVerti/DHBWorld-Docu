## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given iteration. It describes the approach to testing the software.
This Test Plan for DHBWorld supports the following objectives:

- Identifies the items that should be targeted by the tests.
- Identifies the motivation for and ideas behind the test areas to be covered.
- Outlines the testing approach that will be used.
- Identifies the required resources and provides an estimate of the test efforts.

### 1.2 Scope

In our project we will be using functional testing using JUnit and AndroidJUnit4 for functional tests, Cucumber for UI tests and we will be doing a usability test with out users.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

This document is intended for internal documentation and overview over the testing enviroment. This is a living document with the intend of been completed at the end of the fourth semester.

## 2. Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation

### 2.1 Background

Testing serves to ensure that the written code does what it is intended to do. It also prevents future code changes to break existing functionality unnoticed. In the context of integration it can also prevent broken software states to be merged into secured VC branches.

### 2.2 Evaluation Mission

The goals of testing is the improvement and preservation of the functionality and quality of the project. Therefore the tests are focused on reporting issues with functionality and quality. Also bugs should be minimized.

### 2.3 Test Motivators

These test support the effort of better quality, less bugs and faster development.

## 3. Target Test Items

The listing below identifies those test items software, hardware, and supporting product elements Â¾that have been identified as targets for testing. This list represents what items will be tested.

- Android Devices
  - From API Level 26 up to Level 31
  - Different screen sizes

## 4. Outline of Planned Tests

### 4.1 Outline of Test Inclusions

*Frontend/Backend: Android Client*:

- UI testing of views/fragments
- Unit testing

The tests themself will not be tested and will not account into code coverage.

n/a

### 4.3 Outline of Test Exclusions

We will not test any external API to be working directly because all the APIs are actively maintained and we expect them to be tested by the creators.
