## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given iteration. It describes the approach to testing the software.
This Test Plan for DHBWorld supports the following objectives:

- Identifies the items that should be targeted by the tests.
- Identifies the motivation for and ideas behind the test areas to be covered.
- Outlines the testing approach that will be used.
- Identifies the required resources and provides an estimate of the test efforts.

### 1.2 Scope

In our project we will be using functional testing using JUnit and AndroidJUnit4 for functional tests, Cucumber for UI tests and we will be doing a usability test with out users.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

This document is intended for internal documentation and overview over the testing enviroment. This is a living document with the intend of been completed at the end of the fourth semester.

## 2. Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation

### 2.1 Background

Testing serves to ensure that the written code does what it is intended to do. It also prevents future code changes to break existing functionality unnoticed. In the context of integration it can also prevent broken software states to be merged into secured VC branches.

### 2.2 Evaluation Mission

The goals of testing is the improvement and preservation of the functionality and quality of the project. Therefore the tests are focused on reporting issues with functionality and quality. Also bugs should be minimized.

### 2.3 Test Motivators

These test support the effort of better quality, less bugs and faster development.

## 3. Target Test Items

The listing below identifies those test items software, hardware, and supporting product elements Â¾that have been identified as targets for testing. This list represents what items will be tested.

- Android Devices
  - From API Level 26 up to Level 31
  - Different screen sizes

## 4. Outline of Planned Tests

### 4.1 Outline of Test Inclusions

*Frontend/Backend: Android Client*:

- UI testing of views/fragments
- Unit testing

The tests themself will not be tested and will not account into code coverage.

### 4.2 Outline of Other Candidates for Potential Inclusion

n/a

### 4.3 Outline of Test Exclusions

We will not test any external API to be working directly because all the APIs are actively maintained and we expect them to be tested by the creators.

## 8. Testing Workflow
tbd.

[Provide an outline of the workflow to be followed by the test team in the development and execution of this Test Plan.
The specific testing workflow that you will use should be documented separately in the project's Development Case. It should explain how the project has customized the base RUP test workflow (typically on a phase-by-phase basis). In most cases, we recommend you place a reference in this section of the Test Plan to the relevant section of the Development Case. It might be both useful and sufficient to simply include a diagram or image depicting your test workflow.
More specific details of the individual testing tasks are defined in a number of different ways, depending on project culture; for example:
* defined as a list of tasks in this section of the Test Plan, or in an accompanying appendix
* defined in a central project schedule (often in a scheduling tool such as Microsoft Project)
* documented in individual, "dynamic" to-do lists for each team member, which are usually too detailed to be placed in the Test Plan
* documented on a centrally located whiteboard and updated dynamically
* not formally documented at all
Based on your project culture, you should either list your specific testing tasks here or provide some descriptive text explaining the process your team uses to handle detailed task planning and provide a reference to where the details are stored, if appropriate.
For Master Test Plans, we recommend avoiding detailed task planning, which is often an unproductive effort if done as a front-loaded activity at the beginning of the project. A Master Test Plan might usefully describe the phases and the number of iterations, and give an indication of what types of testing are generally planned for each Phase or Iteration.
Note: Where process and detailed planning information is recorded centrally and separately from this Test Plan, you will have to manage the issues that will arise from having duplicate copies of the same information. To avoid team members referencing out-of-date information, we suggest that in this situation you place the minimum amount of process and planning information within the Test Plan to make ongoing maintenance easier and simply reference the "Master" source material.]

## 9. Environmental Needs

### 9.1 Base System Hardware
